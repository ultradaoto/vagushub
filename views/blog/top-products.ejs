            <h2>THE VAGUS NERVE</h2>
            
            <p>The secret is out, folks.</p>
            
            <p>More and more people are learning just how important the Vagus Nerve is to their entire spectrum of personal health.</p>
            
            <p>In fact, it might be one of the most important bundle of nerves that you will ever have the pleasure of working on in your lifetime.</p>
            
            <p>So, I have put together a nice resource list for those who wish to take things to the next level, and really have all the things you need to start developing a super healthy Vagus Nerve.</p>

            <h2>SUPPLEMENTS</h2>
            
            <p>Here are some of the Must Have supplements to take to immediately protect the Myelin with B12, and Omega fatty Acids:</p>
            
            <p><i><b>Methyl B12</b></i> is essential for the health of neurons in your brain, and in your body, but most importantly in your Vagus Nerve.</p>

            <h2>TOOLS</h2>
            
            <p>A new addition to this page is a list of home-care products that offer a more complete set of "attack vectors" for stimulating your own Vagus Nerve at home.</p>
            
            <p>It is the foundational principle of our ecosystem that it's better to have a practice that you can do every single day, rather than something you only do every two weeks.</p>
            
            <p><b><i>Consistency is Key!</i></b></p>
            
            <p>The following are products you should have on hand, as they can allow you create consistency in your daily routines for achieving good health.</p>

            <div class="product-section">
                <h3>Vibration Plate for Deep Vagal Activation (Bonus: For Weight Loss!)</h3>
                <p>When used daily, you can seriously get one of the greatest cardio boosts if you use this vibration plate in the morning.</p>
                <p>This particular system below really jumped out because it includes resistance bands, which you can use while on the plate to get an extra boost of muscle building resistance training.</p>
                <p>Not to mention, it just feels freaking good!</p>
                
                <div class="product-card">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794BXVY4/ref=as_li_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        <img src="/images/blog/LifePro-Waver-Vibration-Plate-LG.jpg" alt="LifePro Vibration Plate">
                        <h4>LifePro Vibration Plate Exercise Machine</h4>
                    </a>
                </div>

                <h3>Chi Machine</h3>
                <p>This is an incredible system to use if you want to wakeup early, and get the blood flowing.</p>
                <p>And, if you combine with the breathing exercise, there's no telling just how unbelievably amazing you're going to feel. This will allow you to send your breathing to even longer breath holds, and put your mind deeper into your Vagus Nerve than you've ever thought possible.</p>
                <p>Just 15 minutes on this Chi Machine is worth an equivalent amount of 60 minutes worth of walking in terms of circulation, and movement of important lymphatic fluids.</p>
                
                <div class="product-card">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DQWQNM/ref=as_li_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                    </a>
                </div>

                <h3>Rebounder, Lymphatic Trampoline</h3>
                <p>For a slower, but more forceful resonant activity which helps move lymphatic fluid through your body, I recommend also a Rebounder.</p>
                <p>These are basically mini-trampolines that help exert 3 times the force of gravity on your body, which can help push lymph fluid to pass through your body.</p>
                <p>These are fun, and are a great form of cardio!</p>

                <h3>Red Light Therapy (660nm)</h3>
                <p>This technology is so under-represented in healthcare, but it's power is immense.</p>
                <p>This particular setup offers a full body Red Light experience.</p>
                <p>What is it about red light therapy that has so many becoming raving fans?</p>
                <p>Well it primarily has to do with its activation of Mitochondria in the body, and these mitochondria power the Vagus Nerve.</p>
                <p>Without mitochondria, your Vagus Nerve wouldn't work, at all, and neither would the rest of your body.</p>
                
                <div class="product-card">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PKM2R8Y/ref=as_li_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                </div>

                <h3>Infrared & Red Light Therapy System (850nm) & (660nm)</h3>
                <p>There are also ways to combine Infrared and Red light therapy together into one panel.</p>
                <p>This one in particular is a great value!</p>

                <h2>TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL</h2>
                <p>It's always great knowing you have products on hand to help push your health in the right direction. However, it's one thing to have the tools on hand, it's another thing to know exactly how to utilize them properly.</p>
                <p>That's why I created the Vagus Nerve Stimulation & Repair Program.</p>
                <p>What this course is all about is having the right strategies, and personalized support you need to ensure you're going in the right direction.</p>
                <p>What I have seen after many years of work in helping people with neurological issues, is that it can be a bumpy ride.</p>
                <p>One week you're going to feel amazing, another week you might feel like you're going backwards again.</p>
                <p><i>It's usually after 2-3 weeks into your own Do-It-Yourself protocol, that you throw your hands up in despair, and accept your fate...</i></p>
                <p><b>That is not how it should be though!</b></p>
                <p>Imagine a possibility in which you could get consistent results, and steady improvement with the assistance of someone who knows what they're doing? And has done it for themself and others many, many times?!</p>
                <p>Well, <u>I want to personally invite you to the </u><b><u>Vagus Nerve Stimulation & Repair Program.</u></b></p>
                <p>We operate by <i>application only</i>, and are very selective in who we work with.</p>
                <p>So if you are concerned that your Vagus Nerve is holding you back from living a full life, then I encourage you to click the link below and it will offer you an opportunity to fill out an application where you can learn more about what this extraordinary program is all about.</p>

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>There are many options for you to pursue a life of feeling your best.</p>
            <p>Another final recommendation to many who are looking to find some inner peace, to make this journey you're going through easier, is to consider adopting some consistent form of self-reflection, be it meditation, or otherwise.</p>
            <p>I remember a fantastic quote recently, which is that we don't meditate for the daily little things, we meditate to prepare us for the hardest day of our lives.</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the journey, you will likely encounter the toughest thing, or multiple things all at once, that will have you doubting why you're here.</p>
            <p>Meditation can help you develop more mental resilience, so that you can get back on your feet, no matter what or who knocks you down.</p>
            <p>I wish you the absolute best in your journey, and am always here to lend a helping hand should you need it.</p>
