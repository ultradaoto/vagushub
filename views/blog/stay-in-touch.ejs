            <p>In this amazing world of social media, and exponential growth of groups, there can naturally be people who wish to shut it down. Unfortunately it seems we are currently under threat of being attacked.</p>

            <p>I can't say why, as that's not my place. But perhaps it's because the Vagus Nerve Stimulation & Repair group is growing at such a rapid pace, it makes others feel they are being left behind in the dust.</p>

            <p>It's unfortunate that others seem to think one person's gain, is another person's loss. This group has been extraordinarily helpful to many, and it would be a shame if it were shut down.</p>
