            <p>While it's entirely possible to focus too much attention on the things that can go wrong when the Vagus Nerve is not working very well, it is also essential to understand the massive upside of proper stimulation.</p>

            <p>The Vagus Nerve is an exceptionally interconnected "semi-organ." I call it this because it's so large it practically acts as a distributed brain, traveling through your torso and neck.</p>
            
            <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that this system, when stimulated, produces so many diverse responses. While some ask why the medical community hasn't embraced it more, those of us who stimulate our Vagus Nerve daily simply enjoy the results.</p>
