        <div class="post-body">
            <p>While it's entirely possible to focus too much attention on the things that can wrong when the Vagus Nerve is not working very well, that's an important part of the learning process for many who just have no clue.</p>

            <p>However, in the spirit of balance, I want to share what the benefits of Vagus Nerve Stimulation can be.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Vagus Nerve Stimulation</h2>
            
            <div class="benefits-list">
                <ul>

                    <li>Reduced chronic pain</li>

                    <li>Improved mood stability</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Citations</h2>
            
            <p>Many reading this will immediately ask, "Where are your citations!"</p>
            
            <p>That is an excellent initial reaction, I deeply appreciate that I have so many astute and scientifically minded readers.</p>
            
            <p>The reality is this, if you see a particular benefit that is listed, there may or may not be a citation associated with it. I mean a citation, as in a scientific published paper vouching for such a claim.</p>
            
            <p>If you do find one you are exceptionally curious about, I invite you do the following.</p>
            
            <p>Search in Google "Vagus Nerve" + "increased sexual function" [Insert whatever term you are personally interested in]</p>
            
            <p>And see what you find!</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>The Vagus Nerve is an exceptionally interconnected semi-organ. I say "Semi-Organ" because it's so large, it practically acts as if it's a second brain, instead it's a distributed brain, which travels throughout your torso and neck.</p>
            
            <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise any longer that this semi-organ, when stimulated, can produce so many different types of responses in the human body.</p>
            
            <p>One would have a hard time avoiding the intervening thoughts asking, "Why hasn't the medical community embraced the Vagus Nerve more? Are they benefiting from it not being more widely known?"</p>
            
            <p>But those are just intruding thoughts, and those of us who stimulate our Vagus Nerve on a daily basis don't need or pay much attention to wandering thoughts.</p>
