        <div class="post-body">
            <p>The Vagus Nerve controls nearly every major function in the body.</p>

            <p>This ranges from hormones, digestion, sleep, energy, stress, relaxation, sexual function, heart rate, blood pressure, and the list goes on, and on.</p>

            <p>Needless to say it is important to identify if your specific symptoms point to a Vagus Nerve issue or not.</p>

            <p>Why is it important to identify VN dysfunction?</p>

            <p>It's important because it opens the door to a number of treatments.</p>

            <h2>Briefly, What Does the Vagus Nerve Look Like?</h2>
            <p>No picture can really do the Vagus Nerve justice.</p>
            <p>It's so massive and widespread throughout the body that an artists representation cannot capture the sheer size and breadth of this nerve.</p>
            <p>Although, we will try our best to provide a few reference photos that can help set the scene for you.</p>

            <h2>Uvula Deviation Self-Test</h2>
            <p>When a doctor looks into the back of your throat and has you say, "Ahhh" they are looking at your Uvula.</p>
            <p>If your Uvula deviates to the left or the right, instead of raising up straight, this is an indication of a Vagus Nerve problem.</p>
            <p>Even if your uvula doesn't deviate, however, that doesn't mean you don't have a Vagus Nerve problem.</p>
            <p>This is akin to testing one normally "hidden" aspect of your Vagus Nerve.</p>
            <p>Doing the test is helpful to get a baseline of function, so you can also track progress if/when you incorporate a Vagus Nerve Repair Protocol.</p>

            <h2>The Gut-Brain Axis</h2>
            <p>It's all too common to forget that the "axis" in gut-brain axis refers to the Vagus Nerve.</p>
            <p>More often than not you will find people with serious health issues that have a Vagus Nerve problem.</p>
            <p>You can see just how instrumental the nerve is in regulating a diverse array of bodily functions.</p>

            <h2>What *isn't* a Vagus Nerve Issue?</h2>
            <p>It can seem to some that we are unfairly classifying as many symptoms as "Vagus Nerve" related in order to capture everything.</p>
            <p>This is just not the case.</p>
            <p>There are symptoms and dysfunctions of the body that are *not* at all tied to Vagus Nerve processes.</p>
            <p>For instance, radiating pain in your left shoulder, or a broken toe is not a Vagus Nerve issue.</p>
            <p>We do know, however, that problems such as rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, and Vagus Nerve Stimulation can directly relieve rheumatoid arthritis in many patients.</p>
            <p>So is RA a Vagus Nerve dysfunction symptom?</p>
            <p>We will let you be the judge of that.</p>
            <p>Just know that VNS does provide a whole host of benefits to many seemingly unrelated disorders.</p>
            <p>So if you're curious, keep reading ahead.</p>

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>There are a lot more minor symptoms involved.</p>
            <p>If you have any symptoms related to the above listed issues then you most likely have a specific problem in your Vagus Nerve.</p>
