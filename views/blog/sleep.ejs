            <h2>THE SLEEP HYPNOSIS AUDIO</h2>
            
            <p>It's widely accepted that Hypnosis is an effective method to help induce deeper states of relaxation. Since Hypnosis is a non-drug intervention, and additionally because it works so well, we have crafted a specific Vagus Nerve centric Audio Program for clients and readers alike.</p>
            
            <p>In the video above, you can now play the Sleep Induction Audio on your phone, so you are able to listen to the Sleep Induction - which starts at the 6 minute mark.</p>
            
            <p>You will also find the Sleep Audio contains a number of beautiful, cinematic, and relaxing musical soundscapes.</p>

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            
            <p>Hypnosis might seem like it's "Woo-Woo" but think about this.</p>
            
            <p>You can use your own voice to calm and soothe a loved one who is in pain or is mentally suffering in some way. The simple process of speaking calmly to a friend or family member can immediately change their state, and change their perspective, which allows their body to release endorphins and relax them fully.</p>
            
            <p>Why wouldn't it be possible for you to do the same thing to your own body? If we speak to our own bodies we can provide suggestions for how we want our own body to function.</p>
            
            <p>That's exactly what we intend to do with this Sleep Hypnosis Audio Program.</p>
            
            <p>For a more thorough guidebook, please click the Button below which will take you to the full write-up on how to get this Sleep Hypnosis Audio loaded on to a special "Pillow Speaker" system that will absolutely blow your mind.</p>
            
            <p>It's some very cool technology.</p>
            
            <p>Enjoy, and happy sleeping!</p>
