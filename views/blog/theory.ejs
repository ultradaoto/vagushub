            <h2>What Is The Nemertean Vagus Nerve Origin Theory?</h2>
            
            <p>This theory briefly states that the Human Vagus Nerve has it's evolutionary origins in the same Proboscis found inside of the famous Nemertean flat-worm.</p>
            
            <p>We will lay out implications, data, and falsifiability tests that could prove this theory invalid, or incorrect.</p>
            
            <p>We highly encourage readers, and scientists to perform tests to help refute and falsify this theoretical framework for understanding how the Vagus Nerve arrived inside of the mammalian body some 500 Million Years Ago.</p>

            <h2>What Evidence Do We Have So Far?</h2>
            
            <p>Our primary evidence is RNA evidence taken from the Proboscis of a Nemertean worm, and comparing the RNA segments to those found inside of the Mammalian side.</p>
            
            <p>We will list out the data below, and you will also understand through the "falsification tracks" how we are thinking through this unique problem / theory.</p>
            
            <p>We also believe there is observable similarities between the behavior of the Proboscis and that of the Vagus Nerve, which we will also detail that below.</p>
            
            <p>Lastly, we believe there is evidence of an evolutionary / consciousness / Quantum Pleasure Principle type of pressure mechanism that allowed / encouraged this strange and rather sci-fi pairing of worming proboscis and fish body to occur.</p>

            <h2>What is the RNA Evidence Showing a Potential Link Between the Nemertean Proboscis and the Human Vagus Nerve?</h2>
            
            <p>A study was performed, on the Proboscis of the Nemertean Worm, and it found that the proboscis had some unique functions, that 1) overlap with functions of the human Vagus Nerve and 2) when analyzed using the unique RNA codes - COCA1, RADI, VWF, etc, going down the list, showed an incredible amount of "matches" to the Pig RNA atlas.</p>
            
            <p>I will post a number of the "Matches" and explain further below - the research came from this paper: Evolution, Expression Patterns, and Distribution of Novel Ribbon Worm Predatory and Defensive Toxins - Verdes 2022</p>

            <h2>The Above Study Found a Significant Number of Matches That Aligned with Functions of the Vagus Nerve</h2>
            
            <p>Below, the proboscis was analyzed, and you can see how a number of the functions of the proboscis are given, such as digestion, immune response, secretion, cell adhesion, all functions that are quite important in the Vagus Nerve.</p>
            
            <p>But how overlapping can these things get? Scroll down to see the results from the RNA Atlas: <a href="https://www.rnaatlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.rnaatlas.org/</a></p>

            <h2>The RNA Atlas Results Match Overwhelmingly</h2>
            
            <p>Let's look at the RNA segment names on the right side of the 'proboscis' column, the first sequence is titled: COCA1 - which is a repeating segment of RNA that has been given a name.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what it looks like when you run that through the RNA Atlas:</p>

            <h2>COCA1 - Representing Cell Adhesion - Is a Match in Humans</h2>
            
            <p>Taken as a single match, it's not substantial, but here are more matches down the list:</p>

            <h2>Falsification Tracks to Follow</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>RNA data showing the Vagus Nerve is not a descendent of the Nemertean Proboscis.</li>
                <li>Cutting the Vagus Nerve in a healthy mammal should result in a regrowing of the Vagus Nerve, just as the Proboscis is able to fully regenerate</li>
                <li>The human "freeze" response that happens when a predator or startling event happens should be mitigated when the Vagus Nerve is suppressed</li>
                <li>The Nemertean Proboscis should have a fast acting myelination feature, as well as similarly structured Microtubule networks as the human Vagus Nerve</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>List of the Collected Benefits of Vagus Nerve Stimulation</h2>
            
            <ul class="benefits-list">
                <li>Improved mood</li>
                <li>Loss of anxiety</li>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
                <li>Better social skills</li>
                <!-- ... continue with all benefits ... -->
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Nemertean Proboscis is the Missing Link to Explain how the Vagus Nerve suddenly "appeared" in fish all of the sudden, giving rise to rapid Lung development through Resting Sinus Arrhythmia allowing Lung Fish to breathe air, and ultimately allowing fish to walk on land.</p>
            
            <p>We also believe that the Proboscis of the Nemertean worm is itself a Conscious creature, and may have its own form of consciousness semi-separate from the Nemertean Worm.</p>
            
            <p>That's it! For now!</p>
